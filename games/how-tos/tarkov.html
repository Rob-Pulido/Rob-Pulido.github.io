                <h2>How To Play</h2>
                <h3>Starting out</h3>
                In Escape From Tarkov, there is never a dull moment. Be prepared to think fast and move fast! Unless
                joining with a team, everyone is your enemy. You're first priority should be to gather loot and survive
                the round by extracting in a designated area on the map. Get to know the maps! Unlike most games, the
                HUD for Tarkov is extremely minimal, so knowing where you are through identification of your
                surroundings is a must. See someone? Shoot them! Because without a doubt, whether player or Scav
                (Player/AI), they will shoot to kill.
                <hr>
                <h3>Whats Next</h3>
                Play a few rounds, get to know the gameplay and mechanics, then you'll realize you've probably lost more
                than you've gained at this point.. Luckily, you dont have to risk everything you come in with every
                round. In Tarkov, you have the option to play as a player scav every 20 minutes. Which means, you go
                in-place of AI, and the game will equip you (minimally) with enough gear to survive. If you do survive,
                you keep everything you gained (including what you started with) from the round. This can be extremly
                profitable, if you know the best routes to loot, and are lucky enough to survive the round without
                running into extremely geared players. Although, catching a geared player offguard happens quite often.
                Additionally, a faceshot is a faceshot. So if you're talented and/or lucky, you could extract pretty
                wealthy.
                <hr>
                <h3>End Game</h3>
                There really is no end game when it comes to Escape From Tarkov. Eventually, your account may become
                stacked with items. You may get to a point where you enter rounds more geared than you ever thought
                possible. It really doesnt negate the fact that pvp is the sole basis for this game. While being heavily
                geared in armor, and having highly penetrable bullets, if you are trash with your aim, you wont stand a
                chance. So practice, practice, practice!
