                <h3>Starting out</h3>
                Since 7 Days to Die is a surival sandbox, you're first priority should be... Survival. Raw materials are
                essential, which means you should gather everything possible with in the first few minutes of gameplay.
                Rocks, Grass, Wood, Etc.. Luckily, the developers have set up a pretty good system with giving new
                players a good idea of where to start by using starter quests. These quests, displayed on your screen,
                provide a visual lists of materials to craft your first weapons, clothes, shelter, and everything else
                to get you started.
                <hr>
                <h3>Whats Next</h3>
                Once you get the feel for gathering, your next adventure begins with exploring towns. While these areas
                provide the best loot, such as food, weapons, and components for more advanced crafting, they are also
                your most likely area for encountering large volumes of zombies. The risk is worth the reward! Be sure
                to explore these areas during the daytime, because at night zombies can run!
                <hr>
                <h3>End Game</h3>
                So you've established a decent collection of items and setup what you think is a solid base? Think
                again! On a player versus player (pvp) server, this is where things get interesting. From the get-go
                your number one priority has been survival. What do you think other players are thinking? Well..
                They want what you have! Interactions on a pvp server (depending on the population) can be few and
                far between, or around every corner. If you're starting out on day one of a dedicated servers wipe,
                then be prepared to battle it out with others with rocks, bow and arrows, or spears. As the game
                advances, AK-47's, Sniper rifles, even Rocket Launchers become a must have in your inventory at all
                times. If you kill someone, not only do you get the satisfaction of a win, but you also get
                everything in their inventory!
