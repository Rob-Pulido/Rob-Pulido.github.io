                <p>
                    Hello everyone! My name is Rob P., I’m 37 years old, and I’m from Lancaster California. I’m currently in the Air Force and have been for over 18 years.
                    I joined the military as a Crew Chief and have had the chance to work multiple airframes. On top of working the line as an ADCC and DCC, I have worked CDDAR,
                    Aero-Repair, Wheel & Tire, Quality Assurance, Flight Line Expediter, Section Chief, Production Superintendent, and I am now a Quality Assurance Superintendent.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    I began programming as a hobby, stemming from my love for gaming. Before starting my degree plan, I took time to learn C#, Python, XML, JSON, SQL, and a bit of HTML.
                    Ideally, I’ll take my knowledge gained from a Computer Science degree and focus on shifting from programming supplementary APIs for games to creating my own.
                    My favorite games are built using the Unity Engine, which uses C#.
                    However, I recognize that Unreal Engine is where the power is. After finishing my degree, I plan to focus on learning C++ and any other programming language I can.
